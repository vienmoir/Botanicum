Betula pendula, commonly known as silver birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia.
The silver birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to the white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall.
