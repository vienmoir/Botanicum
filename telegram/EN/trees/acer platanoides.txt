Acer platanoides (Norway maple) is a species of maple native to eastern and central Europe and western Asia. 
It is a deciduous tree, growing to 20–30 m tall with a trunk up to 1.5 m in diameter, and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey-brown and shallowly grooved. Unlike many other maples, mature trees do not tend to develop a shaggy bark.
