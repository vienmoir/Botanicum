Aesculus hippocastanum is commonly known as horse-chestnut or conker tree. 
It is a large deciduous, synoecious tree, growing to about 39 metres tall with a domed crown of stout branches; on old trees the outer branches often pendulous with curled-up tips. The leaves are opposite and palmately compound, with 5–7 leaflets.
