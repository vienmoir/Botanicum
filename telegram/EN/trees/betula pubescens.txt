Betula pubescens (syn. Betula alba), commonly known as downy birch, is a species of deciduous tree, common throughout Europe and Asia, growing farther north than any other broadleaf tree. 
It is a deciduous tree growing to 10 to 20 m tall, with a slender crown and a trunk up to 70 cm in diameter, with smooth but dull grey-white bark finely marked with dark horizontal lenticels.
